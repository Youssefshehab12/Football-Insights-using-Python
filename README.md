# Football Insights Bar Charts using-Python

This project allows Data Analysts who are passionate about Football (it's okay if you are not) to visualize Football teams stats using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.

Created bar charts analysis for which Danish Superliga teams committed more fouls than they received in season 2021/2022.

# The Analysis contains bar charts for:
-Total Fouls Committed by each team.

-percentage of Fouls Committed in Home games compared to away games for each team.

-The amount of Fouls committed compared to the amount of Fouls received for each team.

-The ratio of Fouls conceded to Fouls received for each team using their logos.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, if you're using a Jupyter Notebook ensure that:

run the following line at the top of your notebook, to ensure we're using the same matplotlib version.
```bash
!pip install matplotlib --upgrade
```
# The Data
we'll go beyond the commonly used top-5 European leagues and explore Danish Superligaen data.

You can download the csv file, which contains foul data from the 2021/2022 season, from the following link:
