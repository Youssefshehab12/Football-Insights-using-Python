# Football Insights using-Python

This repository allows Data Analysts who are passionate about Football (it's okay if you are not) to visualize Football teams stats using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.

Before we dive into the Analysis I want to give credit to [sonofacorner](https://github.com/sonofacorner) for his amazing tutorials.


# Analysis

**1) Which Danish Superliga teams committed more fouls than they received in season 2021/2022 ?**

- Total Fouls Committed by each team.

- percentage of Fouls Committed in Home games compared to away games for each team.

- The amount of Fouls committed compared to the amount of Fouls received for each team.

- The ratio of Fouls conceded to Fouls received for each team using their logos.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, if you're using a Jupyter Notebook ensure that:

run the following line at the top of your notebook, to ensure we're using the same matplotlib version.
```bash
!pip install matplotlib --upgrade
```
# The Data
1) Explore Danish Superligaen data.
You can download the csv file, which contains foul data from the 2021/2022 season, from the following link:
[Data](https://www.sonofacorner.com/content/files/2022/06/superligaen_fouls_tutorial_06172022.csv)

2) Explore Arsenal squad data through this website [FBRef](https://fbref.com/en/squads/18bb7c10/2021-2022/Arsenal-Stats) where you can find all the teams and players data too not just Arsenal's.
 
 All you need is to go to the table of your choice and click on export CSV, then copy and paste that data into an empty notepad file and save it as your_file_name.csv
