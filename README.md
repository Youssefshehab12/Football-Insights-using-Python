# Football Insights Bar Charts using-Python

Created an Analysis on which Danish SuperLiga teams committed more fouls than they received in season 2021/2022 using Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.

The Analysis contains bar charts for "Total Fouls Committed by each team", for "Percentage of Fouls Committed in Home games compared to away games for each team" , for " The amount of Fouls committed compared to the amount of Fouls received for each team" , and for " The ratio of Fouls conceded to Fouls received for each team using their logos".
